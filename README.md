# MONTY HALL PYTHON SIMULATION
> As part of a Mathematical Exploration Paper â€“ "Solving the Monty Hall Problem Through Bayesian Decision Theory and Mathematical Modelling" 

This program simulates three different variations of the Monty Hall Problem:
- Original Monty Hall
- Forgetful Monty Hall
- 2 Prize Monty Hall

## [Automated Monty Hall Simulator](https://github.com/ofimikfra/MontyHallSimulation/blob/master/MontyHall-Automated.py)
This is the automated version of the Monty Hall Simulator. Player choices are randomly designated. 
> Each variation can be simulated multiple times, and at the end, the results of the simulations are shown.

## [Interactive Monty Hall Simulator](https://github.com/ofimikfra/MontyHallSimulation/blob/master/MontyHall-Interactive.py)
This is the interactive version of the Monty Hall Simulator. You are able to control the choices through manual input.

### Original Monty Hall Problem
The original Monty Hall problem consists of 3 doors: 2 of which contain goats and 1 that contains a prize. The objective is to choose the door containing the prize. After the initial choice, a door containing a goat is revealed and removed from the choices, leaving two doors unopened. 
> This variation can be simulated with 3 doors or more. There will always be 2 remaining doors.

### Forgetful Monty Hall
The forgetful Monty Hall variation is almost the same as the original, but the revealed door chosen randomly. There is a chance that the door containing the prize is revealed, ending in the player losing the game immediately.

### 2 Prize Monty Hall
The 2 prize Monty Hall variation consists of 4 doors: 2 of which contain goats and the other 2 containing prizes. The mechanics are the same as the original Monty Hall problem except for the number of doors and prizes.

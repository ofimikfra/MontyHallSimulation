# MONTY HALL PYTHON SIMULATION

This program simulates three different variations of the Monty Hall Problem:
- Original Monty Hall
- Forgetful Monty Hall
- Monty Hall with 2 goats & 2 cars

Each variation can be simulated multiple times, and at the end, the overall results of the simulations are shown (e.g. number/percentage of wins, losses, switches, etc.)

## [Automated Monty Hall Simulator](https://github.com/ofimikfra/MontyHallSimulation/blob/master/MontyHall-Automated.py)
This is the automated version of the Monty Hall Simulator. Player choices are randomly designated. 

## [Interactive Monty Hall Simulator](https://github.com/ofimikfra/MontyHallSimulation/blob/master/MontyHall-Interactive.py)
This is the interactive version of the Monty Hall Simulator. You are able to control the player choices through manual input.

### Original Monty Hall Problem
The original monty hall problem consists of 3 doors: 2 of which contain goats and 1 that contains a car. The objective is to choose the door containing the car. After the initial choice, a door containing a goat is revealed and removed from the choices, leaving two doors unopened.

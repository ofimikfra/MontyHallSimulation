# MONTY HALL PYTHON SIMULATION

This is a program that simulates three different variations of the Monty Hall Problem:
- Original/Normal Monty Hall
- Forgetful Monty Hall
- Monty Hall with 2 goats & 2 doors

The program can be simulated multiple times, and at the end, the results of the simulations are shown (e.g. number/percentage of wins, losses, switches, etc.)

> This was made for my math research paper and is for academic purposes lol :+1:

## [Automated Monty Hall Simulator](ofimikfra/MontyHall-Automated.py)
This is the automated version of the Monty Hall Simulator. Player choices are randomly decided in the code. 
This version is useful for running multiple simulations at a time.

## [Interactive Monty Hall Simulator](ofimikfra/MontyHall-Interactive.py)
This is the interactive version of the Monty Hall Simulator. You are able to control the player choices. 
This version is kind of like a game, where the instructions and steps are shown. You can still run multiple simulations, but it will take a while since everything is manually inputted.
